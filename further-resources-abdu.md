### Courses

The learning material to prepare for [Databricks certification](https://academy.databricks.com/exam/databricks-certified-associate-developer) is available on the official website. 

However, the price for official training is quite high. For the time being, MOOC course with high number of enrollments is [Databricks Fundamentals & Apache Spark Core](https://www.udemy.com/course/databricks-fundamentals-apache-spark-core/). This course is aimed to teach how to process big-data using Databricks & Apache Spark 2.4 and 3.0.0 - DataFrame API and Spark SQL. 


Additionally, [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/apache-spark-3-databricks-certified-associate-developer) for **Apache Spark 3 - Databricks Certified Associate Developer** is very well organized course that helps to earn the Databricks Associate Certification to prove your skills as data professional! 

[Big Data Analysis with Scala and Spark](https://www.coursera.org/learn/scala-spark-big-data) is also useful course for getting started with Spark basics. But those who prefer to use Python (not Scala) may take this course [Apache Spark Streaming with Python and PySpark](https://www.udemy.com/course/apache-spark-streaming-with-python-and-pyspark/). 


### Online Guides and Docs

#### Documentation

[Apache Spark documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/index.html) should be your first place to start. It provides a quick introduction to the Spark API, RDD Programming Guide, Spark SQL, Datasets, and DataFrames. Also, the article [10 recommendations after getting the Databricks Certification for Apache Spark](https://towardsdatascience.com/my-10-recommendations-after-getting-the-databricks-certification-for-apache-spark-53cd3690073) is very useful guide for beginners written by a certificate owner.


#### Databricks Resources
