# Further Resources for the Class

This focuses on the materials you can pick on to deepen your knowledge in the subjects we covered in the class. 

Furthermore, materials are from free to quite expensive and from beginner level to more advanced. It was important to include this, as the students of Data Engineering 3 class were on different levels. 

## Cloud Computing and AWS 

### Books
It is important to highlight that books might not be the best source of information as AWS is changing dynamically, almost on a day-to-day basis. However, the three books listed below could be really useful for either starting from the beginning, or preparing for a certificate, etc.

#### Amazon Web Services in Action

Most of the websites, blogs and experts agreed on one thing, that there is no better intro guide than Amazon Web Services in Action. This is the absolute best title for a complete beginner who needs a walkthrough of the AWS platform.
