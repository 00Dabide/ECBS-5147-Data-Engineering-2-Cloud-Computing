## Spark Overview

### Introduction
- Collecting data is extremely inexpensive but processing it requires large, parallel computations, often on clusters of machines
    - That's what Apache Spark was built for

> Apache Spark is a unified computing engine and a set of libraries for parallel data processing on computer clusters that supports programming languages like R, Python, Java and Scala and libraries ranging from SQL to streaming and machine learning and runs everywhere from a laptop to a cluster of thousands of servers making it easy to scale up to big data processing or incredibly large scale.
